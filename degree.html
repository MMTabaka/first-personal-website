    <h1>Degree</h1>
    <p>My programme of Study is Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science with a Year in Industry.
      It focuses on developing programming skills as well as gaining fundamental knowledge in the field.
      The course in the first semester of first year consists of 6 modules. You can find brief descriptions from
      university's website of all of
      them below.</p>

        <p>"This module introduces the Software Engineering concepts that are needed to develop software systems that
          can
          meet basic functional requirements within a given problem domain. It covers the main steps in the process of
          developing such systems, from requirements analysis through to their implementation and testing."

        <p>"This module develops mathematical concepts
          and techniques that are of foundational importance to computing.
          The intention is to enthuse about these topics, to demonstrate why they are important to us, to lay the
          foundations of their knowledge and prepare students for future computing courses."

        <p>"This module introduces programming concepts through the Java programming language. Program design and the
          use
          of testing to drive program creation are also covered. Initial focus is placed on the structured aspects
          typical of many programming languages: the ideas of a sequence, selection and repetition. The object-oriented
          approach to building large software systems from components is then presented."

        <p>"This module provides an introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and to key concepts and problems in the
          field, such as whether a computer is capable of understanding, and whether humans should themselves be viewed
          as machines. It also provides a brief historical overview of the subject and reviews the state-of-the-art and
          open questions in some of the major subareas of AI, pointing out connections to research work in the
          Department."

        <p>"The Web and the Internet are now
          pervasive in modern life, providing an information resource, supporting 'cloud computing', and promoting
          novel, interactive solutions to computing-related activities. This module will cover the basics of networks
          and internetworking, the Web in society, including information security and the technologies that are used in
          Web development, with an emphasis on building a simple interactive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript."

        <p>"This unit provides an overview of core components of cognition, and principles of their investigation. The
          module covers perception, attention, performance, cognitive neuroscience, language, learning, memory and
          reasoning. It introduces and explored key concepts, theoretical perspectives and foundational methods.
          Examples of key studies in cognitive psychology will be considered critically."
