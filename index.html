    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Milosz Tabaka. I am a first year Computer Science student at The University of Sheffield.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page focuses on presenting my work as a part of my degree programme. You can find here information about
      modules I am undertaking to give you an idea how my everyday life at the university
      looks like. It also shows some data about me and gives you an opportunity to try the quiz I created. If you would
      like to contact me for any reason, you can use a form in the contact section to send me an email.

      My interest in Computer Science sparked two years ago when I decided to learn Java as my first programming
      language. I like the idea of creating your own ways to solve problems as well as many other aspects of coding so
      much that I decided
      to fully commit to this field. It would be a shame not to mention my affiliation to Artificial Intelligence and
      cyberpunk. I find it exciting to contemplate about how our society will look like in the future and what
      challenges it will be forced to face because of technological advances.

      I am the type of person that always likes to learn new things. Hobbys are crucial part of my everyday life
      because they
      help me to focus on doing something completely not related to the work I have to do, what has a positive impact on
      my mental health. Recently I started to learn japanese.
      I was considering taking up a language with completely different alphabet than latin one for a long time to see
      how does it feel to be unable to read automatically and eventually learn to do it from scratch.
      You can see in the image first kanji character I have recently learnt to write.
